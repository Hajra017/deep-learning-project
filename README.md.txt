# Deep Learning Medical Image Classification

## Project Overview
This Jupyter notebook implements a complete deep learning pipeline for medical image classification. It includes data preprocessing, stain normalization, and model training using PyTorch.

## Features
- Converts .mat medical images to PNG format
- Implements stain normalization for consistency
- Uses PyTorch for deep learning model
- Works with Google Colab for GPU acceleration
- Includes data augmentation with Albumentations

## How to Use
1. **Google Colab**: Upload this notebook to Google Colab
2. **Mount Google Drive**: Run the first cells to mount your drive
3. **Dataset**: Place your .mat files in Google Drive
4. **Run All**: Execute all cells sequentially

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for all Python packages needed.
